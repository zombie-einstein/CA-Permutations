## Python Implementation

This supports rulesets up to aribitary number of states, but only neigbours adjecent to a cell
Note numbers grow quickly, for **s** states three cells have **S**<sup>3</sup> possible states, ca is then mapping from these cell permutations back to **S** so there are then (**S**)<sup>**S**<sup>3</sup></sup> possible rulesets
